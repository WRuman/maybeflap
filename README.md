# MaybeFlap
Testing out Kotlin with Java's famous Swing libraries, 
featuring some cool moving blocks for now.

## Build
You'll need gradle version 4 and Java JDK 1.8.
In theory, that's all you need to run a successful build.

## Purpose
With some additional side-projects in mind, I wanted to get a
feel for writing Kotlin against the Swing APIs. Hopefully
there's some useful example code in here for anyone who 
comes across it.
